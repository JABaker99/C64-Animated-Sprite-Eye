##C64 Sprite Eye Animation

This project builds on the instructor’s starter code and implements a fully animated sprite eye on the Commodore 64. The program loads three separate eye sprite frames (front, left, and right), installs an interrupt-driven animation routine, and animates the eye so it looks left and right in a smooth cycle.
